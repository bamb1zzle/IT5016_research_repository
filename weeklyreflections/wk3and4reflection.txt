Wk3 & Wk 4 Reflection:

These next two weeks worked better for me. I really enjoy getting activities to work on to grasp the ropes.

I learned about:
- Creating variables 
- The importance of assigning property types to inputs  
- That formulas/learning maths is important for making efficient code 
- Most importantly, to keep seeking more.

My last point is important to me because if I only answer the questions to the requirements, I'm only searching for the bare minimum.
This limiting mindset blocks me from actual learning that comes from the interests in my mind, e.g. "what if I do...". 

I don't like that when I asked Pinal for help on making my code better he just told me that it wasn't necessary as the questions already answered. I think that pissed me off the most but it reinforces the idea for me that I just need to find the answer myself. I understand why he answered me the way he did but I just wish he didn't shut down my curiosity without a further thought into who I am as a student.

Notes after activities:
1. Maths is necessary for limiting the lines of code you do. Efficiency is key. 
2. If you want to loop a program you have to define it. 
3. Make sure to define the type of data. You cannot do 1/2 if one of them is considered a string, E.G. int/str. Must convert to int/int for it to work.
4. "For i in range" use this more to get used to working with it. REALLY useful.
